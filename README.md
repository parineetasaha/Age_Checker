# Age_Checker

This is a simple Age Checker web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user enters their age into a text box and clicks the "submit" button. The application then checks the entered age and displays a message based on the input. The design is basic, but you can enhance it further with custom CSS for a more attractive appearance.
